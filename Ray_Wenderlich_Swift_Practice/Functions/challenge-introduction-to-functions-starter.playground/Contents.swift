 ### INTRODUCTION TO FUNCTIONS
 
 Write a function named `printFullName` that takes two strings called `firstName` and `lastName`.  The function should print out the full name defined as `firstName` + " " + `lastName`. Use it to print out your own full name.
 */

// TODO: Write solution here

 Change the declaration of `printFullName` to have no external name for either parameter.
 */

 Write a function named `calculateFullName` that returns the full name as a string. Use it to store your own full name in a constant.

 Change `calculateFullName` to return a tuple containing both the full name and the length of the name. You can find a stringâ€™s length by using the following syntax: `string.characters.count`. Use this function to determine the length of your own full name.
